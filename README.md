# Wireshark-Hacking-Lab

In this project, we will create a Kali Linux virtual machine (VM) alongside two pre-built FTP VMs within VirtualBox to create a controlled hacking environment. We will intercept and analyze packets transmitted between the FTP VMs using Wireshark. The network packets will be files and login information shared between the VMs. Utilizing Wireshark packet capture capabilities no logs nor traceable events will be generated, ensuring that the capture remains undetected. This project aims to explore Wireshark's capabilities in network traffic analysis and evaluate its effectiveness in identifying security vulnerabilities and enhancing network defenses. Also, we will discuss some best practices to protect your organization's information from being easily stolen by Packet Sniffers such as Wireshark at the end.

This Hacking Lab will consist of the following components:
- Oracle Virtual Box
- Kali Linux VM
- 2 ftp pre-built VMs

***This home lab can be done for free. All Necessary files will be linked directly to this project.***

Before starting, we must download and set up a virtual box. This is very straightforward, so I will not provide a step-by-step guide. If you need assistance, simply watch a short tutorial on YouTube on how to do so. Just make sure that it is from Oracle and adjust whatever you need to to meet your computer's standards.

Once the Virtual Box is set up, we can now download and create our Kali Linux VM.
